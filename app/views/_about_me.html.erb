        <h3>What I do</h3>
        <p class="article">
          I'm a software developer who lives in Portland, Oregon and works at
          <a href="https://www.newrelic.com" target="_blank">New Relic</a>. I
          live with my girlfriend
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericadjohnson2" target="_blank">
            Erica</a>, who is also a software developer. When we're not coding,
            we're often cooking or running together.
        </p>
        <h3>Self-Improvement</h3>
        <p class="article">
          I collect data on many aspects
          of my life from what I eat to what technologies I use each day. The
          data helps direct my self-improvement. I see
          every hour is an opportunity grow, but I don't
          consinder myself a competitive person. I pursue
          self-improvment because it makes me happy.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p class="article">
          I try not to have opinions, unless I've invested significant time
          researching and considering an issue. Even then, I'm open to changing
          my mind if better evidence comes my way. I also try my best to live by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-level_utilitarianism"
          target="_blank">
          two-level utilitarianism</a>,
          which makes me do awkward things like obey pedestrian traffic
          signals that other people tend to ignore.
